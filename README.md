# 📦 Packaging Line Automation – BBM Pvt. Ltd.

## 🏭 Overview
This project focused on designing a conceptual automation solution to improve productivity and reduce labor dependency in the print and packaging line at **BBM Packaging Pvt. Ltd.** The system was developed for **bundling and stacking mono cartons** post-printing using semi-automated methods.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- 💻 **SolidWorks**, **Blender** – For CAD modeling, animation, and layout design  
- 📊 **MATLAB** – For simulating control logic and verifying system flow  
- 🔍 Workflow analysis – Manual process mapping and optimization

## 🚀 What I Did
- Designed a **post-print packaging system** with optimized flow for semi-automated carton handling  
- Prototyped the solution using **SolidWorks** & simulated using **Blender** and **MATLAB**  
- Analyzed manual workflows and introduced points for **robotic intervention**  
- Led the team on system requirement analysis, documentation, and logic development

## 📈 Outcomes
- Reduces manual effort and increases operational reliability  
- Improves packaging workflow efficiency  
- Identified multiple areas for automation-based productivity boosts
